- Navigation helpers: `nav.html` plus standalone links like `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, and `README.md`.

## Section Directories
- `maps/` – interactive locale pages (`crystalline_lattice.html`, `gateway.html`, `luminal_depths.html`, `void_explorer.html`, `void_forest.html`).
- `bc7f2a/` – experimental manifesto (`synergistic_manifesto.html`).
